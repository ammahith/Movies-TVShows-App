## Description

**MoviesApp** is a fully-featured, Android application built for exploring movies, TV shows, and entertainment personalities — all powered by the TMDB API.

This isn't your average API demo. This app is architected using **MVVM**, **Jetpack Components**, **Coroutines**, and a clean separation of concerns. It delivers region-specific content, preserves scroll position, and handles edge cases like missing images or networks connections.

Whether you’re checking out the latest blockbuster, binging a trending show, or geeking out on filmography — this app makes discovering great content a smooth, responsive, and visually polished experience.

In short, It’s the movie app you’d actually want to use.
